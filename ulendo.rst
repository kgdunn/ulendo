Introduction
=======================

I recall a poem that I learned in my early boyhood days which was entitled "I remember". The first line began "`I remember, I remember the house where I was born <https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44387/i-remember-i-remember>`_". I cannot remember any more than that nor am I able to name the author of the poem nor the book in which it was contained but I strongly suspect that it was in the book that was in use in schools in those days and which was entitled "`Palgrave's Golden Treasury <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palgrave%27s_Golden_Treasury>`_". The reason for these remarks is simply that although I cannot remember some things, there is much that I do recollect of my early boyhood, my youth, early manhood and right through my life to this present point in time.

I have often thought of setting down some of the things I can recall from my.life and more than once I have been urged to do this, but just about four months ago my wife and I were on holiday at `Springs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springs,_Gauteng>`_ in the Transvaal staying with Grenvil, our son and his wife and family. One evening as we were talking together as a family and as will happen, some of the events of my early days came before me and I was constrained to tell some of the stories and anecdotes of the early days. My daughter in law, Jenny, said very quietly to me "*Dad, you must really set down on paper for us all, a record of your memories of your early days*". I pondered on this for some time and then I said to her "*Jenny, you are quite right*"! This set a seal to it and so I see that I must do it.

Four months have rolled away and so far I have not got around to it. It seems that I have always had in mind that I must clear off all the outstanding jobs on my list before I tackle the matter of writing my memoirs. Last Saturday was 14th February, St Valentines Day and listening to the SABC radio programme I heard listeners who, in response to a broadcast invitation had written about "*The most romantic moment of my life*". My wife and I listened to this programme and it was evident to both of us that many of the stories were linked to the days of the Second World War. We looked at each other as we listened, both of us realising that we too could well have reported equally from our own experiences in those dark wartime days. One of the stories sent in by a lady which was related to those days was shown by her before submission, to her grown up children and in amazement they had said to her "*Mum, why did you never tell us about this? We wish we had known all of this*". This broadcast programme reinforced my resolve to get on with what our story is all about and so here I am prefacing my memoirs with this introductory chapter.

In no way has my list of outstanding jobs been completed, nor will it ever be but I now realise that time will have to be set aside and specifically allocated to the task of writing. Now to the task in hand with the wish that the product will be acceptable and interesting.

I cannot begin without remembering those who have done so much for me and helped me in many ways down the avenue of the years. My own family springs to mind, my wife who has meant so much to me since 1938, our children and grandchildren, those who helped to mould and shape my life into the way of faith in God, who in Sunday School and Church, giving voluntary service led me into Christian service and activity and fellowships, all come into my mind with gratitude. Above all I must give thanks to God who is my Heavenly Father and who down the long years has led and guided and guarded us particularly down these last 43 years, for tomorrow 19 Feb 1987 is our 43rd wedding anniversary. So this is a good time to begin this work and dedicate it to the one who has been such a wonderful partner along this journey and who has loved me so faithfully and whom I love dearly.

Chapter 1: Early Days
=======================

The scene is set in the dining room of a neat suburban semi-detached villa in a suburb of `Middlesbrough <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough>`_ in North Yorkshire. The suburb is named `Acklam <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Acklam,+Middlesbrough+TS5+7BN,+UK/@54.5493691,-1.2687398,2198m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487eecb66a872dfd:0x7dc8475733ee311e!8m2!3d54.54937!4d-1.259985>`_. Not far away the Cleveland Hills stretch across the county south of the mouth of the `river Tees <https://www.google.com/maps/@54.5862925,-1.239131,12.28z>`_. The house concerned was our home and during our short stay there we had enjoyed cycling and rambling in the hills very often. My wife and I were the parties to the scene that was enacted on this lovely English summer day in the home that we had owned for just 3 short months. I will always remember that scene for it was to be such an important day in our joint and separate lives. I was reading from a letter which the postman had just delivered. I told her that it looked as though we were going to have the opportunity to move away from England to Central Africa where I would be able to take up employment in a `British Protectorate called Nyasaland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyasaland>`_ and where we would be provided with housing thus meaning that we would be moving our home. There had been discussion about this during the previous two or three weeks when I had applied for the job and when I had gone away to London for interviews, but now I was holding the letter which offered me the appointment. Realising what this meant I remember how we looked straight at each other. This would be a big decision. Neither of us had expected this to happen, particularly as our marriage was just beginning.

We had been married just over three years but out of that period the first two years had been spent abroad with the forces in war time whilst my wife waited and prayed. As we looked at each other and held hands I pondered and many thoughts went through my mind. I thought of how I had spend two periods overseas during the war, first four years then two years and how my wife had never been out of England apart from a short holiday in Scotland. Going abroad would be relatively easy for me but for her I could see that dramatic adjustments would be necessary. There was inevitably a few moments of silence together and then I asked her quietly if she was ready to stand by her word given when I first applied for the post. I could see that she was carefully weighing the matter in her mind and then she nodded, squeezed my hand and gave me an unequivocal. "YES". In those moments we spent most of the time in thinking and continually the word "Nyasaland" rose up before us and we could not help knowing that this was going to be a totally new chapter. As I stood in our dining room that day many scenes from the past leading up to this time, began to unfold in my memory.

The earliest I can remember is how as a little boy, not quite 5 years old, I used to play with other boys in a back street behind a row of working class houses in a little village called `South Church <https://www.google.com/maps/@54.6544273,-1.6639293,428a,35y,184.41h,44.74t/data=!3m1!1e3>`_ on the outskirts of a small market town named Bishop Auckland in south west County Durham. I grew up in these surroundings and went to the village school, which I enjoyed, when I was 5 years of age. I had a happy home life and my home was always neat and clean and respectable. However my parents, like every one else in the village, were poor. Income was derived from the coal mines that were scattered all over that part of County Durham and closures and short time gave rise to a lot of unemployment. Apart from that, working conditions were deplorable, wages were poor and the situation left me with a continual sense of depression and dissatisfaction. Early in my life I began to feel deeply the sense of frustration that my parents experienced and which I am sure was common to most in that environment.

So in those years just after World War I poverty marched through those mining villages, men in their frustration often turned to the public house and there were plenty of those establishments, and became more poverty stricken as they became drunkards. I can see that those were the days of capitalism without a social conscience and the days when militant trade unionism was inevitably spawned. I am thankful that my father was always a non drinker, non smoker and did not gamble so that whatever he earned when he could have employment was available for the running of our home. As a coal miner he had to work hard in difficult and dangerous conditions to make a living to keep us as a family.

My entry to the village school was for me a happy time. From the beginning I found it very interesting. I was taught to write with a slate pencil on a slate, I was taught the alphabet and reading and arithmetic which in those days was called "Sums". I remember that the teachers were kindly folk very much aware of the poor conditions in which we all lived.

In the village there was a very fine example of the Norman architecture in the form of the `village Church of St Andrew <https://www.google.com/maps/@54.6504398,-1.6646563,3a,39.3y,6.4h,105.01t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9y_fQEOWhq3K4K7M-WMatw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656>`_. The choir master/organist was also headmaster of the village school and his wife was the school mistress. There were two Methodist chapels in the village, one Wesleyan and one Primitive. Small as the village was there were five public houses or bars.

As a small boy I became aware of the strictures imposed by the relative poverty which prevailed and from early days I knew that I had to be careful with what I had in the way of clothing and shoes and that I could not expect to get all that I wanted. Playthings were a scarce commodity and at Christmas our parents would do for us all that they could within the limitations placed upon them and certainly this was completely unrelated to the presents received by grandchildren in this day and age.

    :width: 500px

No one could rejoice in having a permanent job. Mines were frequently closed then later re-opened, there would be strikes and stoppages and it was always the families that suffered. I recall the great `General Strike in 1926 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike>`_ when we got near to starvation. Men were desperate and there were many dramatic scenes in those now far off days. My father rented a large piece of ground which was known as `an allotment <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Allotments/@54.6559336,-1.6321312,1906a,35y,267.78h,39.03t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x487e83b5c82a3f2f:0x2957cff7513533e8!4b1!8m2!3d54.661892!4d-1.650714>`_ for 10 shillings a year. When we recall that the family income would be 25 shillings per week this rent spread over the year took a fair portion of the income. However my father saw to it that this allotment was productive and he ensured that we had good supplies of vegetables etc. At the age of 6 years I was taught to plant potatoes for he would often be away at work. Later on he built wooden sheds on some of the ground and raised pigs and poultry and I learned how to look after them too. For me this was all very exciting and I was happy to be involved. It was all part of a battle for survival and I now appreciate having been brought up in those circumstances.

I certainly learned a lot and not least of all to appreciate my having enough to live on in these days. I am sure my mother must have been very worried about it all as she would wonder how she would provide for dad and their three sons and herself. Winter was always a worrying time for good warm clothes and footwear were necessary and often we caught coughs and colds. For her there was always the anxiety over the safety of my father as he worked down the mine. Accidents and fatal ones too were part of the pattern of employment in the pits. My father taught himself to cobble shoes and boots and he used to ensure that our footwear was kept waterproof.

This was the scenario of those early days for me. I could sense the strain of it all yet my parents had a strong sense of self respect and independent spirit and would not seek charity. I look back upon them with pride and could see in them the spirit that was so manifest amongst the Durham mining folk. Hard workers, sticking it out to the end, no wonder the `Durham Light Infantry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Light_Infantry>`_ were known as "the faithful Durhams".

Our playing field was the hard cobbled back street which was often dirty and infected for in those days there was no waterborne sanitation and the earth closet was the means of sanitation. So we played our football or cricket in that back street which was only ten feet wide and had a rough surface. Often we were in trouble when the ball went into someone's backyard. How we longed for a nice smooth playing field but no such facility was available then.

When I was between four and five years of age I was taken by my Aunt Lily, my mother's sister, to the Wesleyan `Methodist Chapel <https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+Church+Methodist+Church/@54.6506202,-1.6666255,16.62z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smethodist+church!3m4!1s0x0:0x393d26a083416941!8m2!3d54.6494034!4d-1.6612034>`_, "*Over the bridge*" as they used to say for this building was for us on the other side of the river Gaunless which wended its way around the village. I went to Sunday School each Sunday morning and this became a great joy to me as I was taught the bible stories and learned off by heart scripture texts. The superintendent and teachers were drawn from our own class but gave of their time and substance to ensure that we children were shown the way of salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ. They were poor like us with little of this world's goods, often little education but they loved Jesus and the Word of God.

I will always be thankful for them and their faithfulness, most of all for the perception that I had of their love for us the coal miner's children and how they wanted us to follow Jesus. These were typical of so many Methodist folk of those days across County Durham who faithfully taught Sunday School. People who had not been to a theological college but they had been to Calvary and met with the life transforming Saviour Jesus Christ and longed to spread His Name abroad. How heartily they used to sing in the chapel services "From sinking sand He lifted me". Often my heart is warmed as I remember some of the things that I learned in that Sunday School. To me there can be no doubt that from that point onward the direction of my life had been settled.


Many other aspects of life in South Church come back to me. I can recall the names of the boys with whom I played. Will I ever forget the day when I fell into the cold, dirty, slimy waters of the `river Gaunless <https://www.google.com/maps/@54.6498102,-1.6687252,783m/data=!3m1!1e3>`_ and as a bedraggled little boy I wended my way home knowing that my father would soon "get to the seat of the problem". School holidays in the summer could be pleasant, catching bees and butterflies along the hedgerows. These we kept in jamjars. We also used jamjars on the end of a piece of string to fish in the river for "tiddlers". If we were lucky we would catch a slightly bigger variety and these were known amongst the juvenile fishing fraternity as "tommies". So, with butterflies, bees, tiddlers and tommies in our jamjars we spent many a day quite happily during the warm summer days of our school holidays. I remember my younger brother, Maurice, being born in 1923 and my youngest brother, Sydney, being born in 1928.

In those days maternity homes were not within the reach of the working classes and so we were all born in the home in which we lived. Generally the family doctor would come for the confinement, there was a lady in the village who was a trained midwife and we understand that she provided her services for a small fee. The doctor used a horse and trap for transport and in those days he would turn out at all hours of the day and night to serve his patients.

At some point in time between 1923 and 1930 the local village school was closed and all the scholars were moved to a Council school at a little place called Coronation about half a mile away. I enjoyed the school and got on quite well. In 1930 I was successful in the annual Secondary School Scholarship examinations. This qualified me to transfer to the `King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland <https://www.google.com/maps/place/King+James+I+Academy/@54.6598369,-1.6719047,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipO8VZUIoaMMj0kmmTBcxnydqmIL5DAMcY3jsqbh!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipO8VZUIoaMMj0kmmTBcxnydqmIL5DAMcY3jsqbh%3Dw114-h86-k-no!7i2048!8i1536!4m5!3m4!1s0x487e8245d95c62ef:0xd2491c8e722297bc!8m2!3d54.6598066!4d-1.6718988>`_ to commence secondary education. I was not sure that I would be able to do this as, although there was no charge for the education, the scholarship did not cover items of uniform and sports gear and this would be extra expense for my parents. At that time this was quite a big item for them but they sacrificed so that I could have the chance of a `Grammar School education <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar_school>`_ and from the word "go" I really appreciated this,

.. image:: KingJamesIGrammarSchool.Google.png

I commenced at the Grammar School in September 1930. To get there I had to walk there and back each morning and each afternoon, a total of 4 miles in the day. I enjoyed the work and the life style and got on quite well. At the end of four years I successfully passed the Cambridge School Certificate examination with matriculation exemption. I had the qualification to carry on for another two years to take Higher School certificate for university entrance. However it was at this point that financial restraints called a halt, for in those days unless one could win a state scholarship or something similar the cost of a university education had to be met by the student or the parents. These scholarships were not plentiful and my parents could not meet the cost. So at the age of 16 years, with a good matric qualification under my belt I went out into the world of business in the small market town of Bishop Auckland. Durham County was still a `depressed area <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Auckland#Industrial_decline>`_ and in 1934 employment was not easy to find.

In October 1934 I commenced my working life as a junior clerk in the office of a firm of plumbers in Bishop Auckland. From the beginning I started to study in the evenings with a private tutor and at night schools. I covered a good number of commercial subjects and was very successful in this field, the cost of fees and books were met out of my earnings. I commenced work with a salary of seven shillings and sixpence per week. My means of transport to and from work was what in those days was known as "`Shanks' pony <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shanks%27_pony>`_". That was also four miles per day.

My pay was handed over to my mother for the family budget but I did have sixpence per week for my own spending money. Those were times of hard work, long hours but a great deal of satisfaction in finding interest in commerce and learning to master the subjects which I was taking. My time at Grammar School had really set me into gear for studying and I found no difficulty in the switch to commerce. I kept this up right through the years leading up to world War II and in 1937/8/9 I found myself preparing for professional examinations by intensive study.

My routine during the winter months from September to April was very exacting. I would commence my daily work at 08.00 a.m. and have lunch break and finish work at 5.00 p.m. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I had to take the bus from Bishop Auckland at 5.30 p.m. to Durham City where I would commence lectures at the Technical School from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. My return bus journey on these nights would drop me at the end of a country lane at 10.30 p.m. I then had to walk approximately one and a half miles to my home in South Church. On dark wintry nights this could be quite an exercise. Usually when I got home the family were in bed but I soon warmed up my cocoa and after a period of further study I would retire.

In the middle of 1939 I passed the intermediate examinations of the Corporation of Certified Secretaries, a professional body which subsequently merged with the `Chartered Institute <http://www.icsaglobal.org/about/>`_ and which caters for the profession which provides company secretaries and administrators. I was quite happy to have got that behind me but with the outbreak of war in September 1939 this plan was interrupted.

During this time of Grammar School, employment and study I had continued my connection with the Methodist Sunday School and Church and especially in the latter years this became to mean very much to me. Due to the Godly influence of our young men's class leader at Wesley Church in Bishop Auckland I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour and committed my life to Him in 1937 and I have never regretted this and found it to be the driving force of my life. Never once has He failed me though many times as I look back I can see where I have failed Him. As I worked actively in Sunday School and in other areas of service at Wesley I became acquainted with a young lady who later became my wife. During those years we found happiness in each other's company and we began going out with each other. But just as my career plans were interrupted so were our plans and I went off to the forces in February 1940.

Basic training took less than three months in Scotland and then there was embarkation leave when Vera and I became engaged. In June of that year I sailed from Liverpool in a very impressive convoy that took us to Sierra Leone, Cape Town, Ceylon, Bombay then Port Suez where after about 5/6 weeks at sea we disembarked and were integrated into the British forces in the Middle East where the main action was taking place in the `Western Desert <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Desert>`_ on the Libyan border with Mussolini's Italian forces. Life in the desert was totally different to what one would imagine. Petrol was more plentiful than water and one learned to adapt to the situation. Sleeping under the desert sky at night was quite different - usually it was very cold but soon after dawn it was very hot - however we got quite accustomed to it.

I served in a unit in the British `7th Armoured Division known as the Desert Rats <http://www.desertrats.org.uk/units.htm>`_. We took part in the battle of El Alamein and in the advance up to the Libyan border and on to Tobruk, Benghazi, Tripoli and finally to Tunis when the Germans surrendered. 7th Armoured was the first Allied formation to enter Tunis and so the war in Africa came to an end. This occurred in May 1943 and we returned to the Mediterranean coast of Libya just East of Tripoli to rest and prepare for the next stage of hostilities. In September that year we handed on the beaches of Salerno in Italy and were engaged in the advance to Naples and the Volturno river. This was what we called the Italian interlude for in late December the whole division handed its vehicles and equipment to a Canadian Armoured division and we sailed in a convoy from Naples for the U.K. The voyage took us out into the Atlantic Ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar and in spite of enemy attempts to interfere the RAF and the Royal Navy took good care of us and we docked in Glasgow on 6th January 1944.

From Glasgow we were moved by a number of troop trains to Norfolk in England and our families were now receiving telegrams from us to say we were in' U.K. Our voyage had for obvious reasons been a secret move and the reason for the move was to become equally obvious as we learned that as a battle seasoned division we were to spearhead some of the landings in Europe later that year. However one can hardly imagine how our families must have felt to know that we were back in U.K.

After a few days I was on my way home for 3 weeks leave. I travelled during the night by train changing at Peterborough, York and Darlington before reaching Bishop Auckland. I will never forget arriving at a familiar platform and seeing in the dim light permitted by blackout restrictions Vera, my mother and father and Vera's mother and father. It was 5.30 a.m. on a dark, cold, wintry morning. I had been away almost four years and I felt strange as I saw them and with the events of those four years pouring through my mind I found it hard to speak and it seemed that all I could do was to greet them. I soon picked up what kit I had and walked with them the one mile journey through the darkness to South Church and into the little family home where I had been brought up. As I settled into an old familiar chair my thoughts flew to my brother, Maurice, serving with `British 46th Infantry Division <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)>`_ in Italy.

I had actually seen him in Italy just for about two hours shortly before leaving for U.K. He had not long been out from U.K. However as familiar things appeared I began to relax and to enjoy being home and with loved ones again. Finally I accepted the situation that for me the war was not over but that this was a happy interlude to be accepted and to be thankful to God for His good hand upon me thus far. It seemed to me that in no time at all Vera's mother and my mother had a good breakfast on the table and with a roaring fire in the grate to warm us all we were around the table enjoying each other's company.

During this leave Vera and I naturally discussed the future. Knowing what I did and having had the long years of front line service I was all too well aware that there were dangers to be faced. However Vera would have none of my suggestions that we postpone until after the end of the war - she expressed her faith that I would come home and so it was that we began to plan our marriage for 19th February subject to my being able to get leave. Upon my return to camp at the end of January I applied for leave and was granted 7 days leave so that we could marry on 19th February. Two other men took leave at the same time. One was Cecil Lambert an old friend of boyhood days and a co-worker in Wesley Sunday School who was also serving in the same division and he came home to be best man. The other was a man from my own unit who came to represent the unit. He actually died in action a few feet from me on the `night of 19 August 1944 in Normandy <http://www.fallenheroesofnormandy.org/Servicemen/DateOfDeath/1944-08-19>`_.

The wedding was at Wesley Church on a cold afternoon. I was in uniform and the wedding was as simple as weddings were in those wartime days. It was however a happy occasion and it was so good to be back in Wesley. That over, we left by train for a seaside place called `Scarborough <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Scarborough,+UK/@54.277265,-0.5354492,11.59z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x487f254b19e38abb:0x69546c0179a47ac7!8m2!3d54.283113!4d-0.399752>`_ on the east coast of Yorkshire where we stayed at a boarding house. It looked like anything but a holiday resort the beach being covered with tank traps and the like. Nevertheless we enjoyed having the opportunity to be alone there.

It was cold, dull weather and as we'd look out to sea I would think of Europe over there and know that in the not distant future we would be landing over there in the final battle of the War. The honeymoon over and back to camp we soon began preparing for the next move. During that period there were two occasions when I found accommodation for Vera in the nearby village of Mundford and so we were able to spend a little more time together before we made our move to the preparation area.

Once our vehicles had been waterproofed etc. we embarked on landing ships in the Thames and one night moved out of the Thames and next morning were off the Normandy beach at `Arromanches <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arromanches-les-Bains,+France/@50.4776097,-1.692026,7.82z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x480a55dae15101c5:0x40c14484fbcfd00!8m2!3d49.339021!4d-0.622415>`_. The sight was beyond my powers of description. The vast armada of all kinds of ships, aircraft of various types, naval craft and landing craft, gliders and much more all involved in urgent activity and the noise of battle over everything, was a very great experience. One hopes that such will never have to occur again. The campaign wore on rather slowly at first until the allies broke out of Normandy and then it began to hot up as we raced northwards to the Seine, to Belgium and Holland. From there the Allied forces crossed the Rhine and battled on. Finally the division had the honour of taking the surrender from the German High Command on 8 May 1945 and being the first British formation to enter Hamburg. There followed long frustrating months of Army of Occupation duties and finally in 1946 I was demobilised and faced with a new responsibility. No longer would I be paid by the Government. I had to go home and find a job quickly. During these days we lived at Vera's parents' home and she was able to continue her work at the armaments factory and help to keep us whilst I was looking for work.

So here we come to Middlesbrough; for it was here I found work and we were able to rent a furnished room in a little bungalow with an elderly couple for twelve shillings and sixpence per week. We started attending the West End Methodist Church and much blessing was added to our lives as we found really warm and deep fellowship with men and women and young people who were really committed to God's service. We have very happy memories of West End as we have of Wesley. Later we moved to a place where we had two unfurnished rooms and were able to use some of the furniture we had been acquiring. That cost us one pound per week but it was not long before we found `22 Britain Avenue in Acklam <https://www.google.com/maps/place/22+Britain+Ave,+Middlesbrough+TS5+7AT,+UK/@54.5502962,-1.256466,3a,75y,225.83h,82.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9B0fK9h5XeyiNwIYbuRpYg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x487eecdaee195e7f:0xe54ddb1342898b59!8m2!3d54.5501906!4d-1.2566648>`_, a semi detached villa with which we fell in love one dark wintry night. We were able to get a mortgage and so after making a deposit of two hundred pounds, taken from my gratuity from the army, we bought it for fourteen hundred pounds and so began a very happy time together setting up our own home some three years after our marriage. We thanked God for permitting us to see this happen and it confirmed Vera's faith.

However all the time I was having the niggling feeling that something would have to change as regards my job which was no more than a routine clerical job and completely out of keeping with my qualification. When I had been demobilised I immediately resumed my studies and my wife was very patient whilst every night except Saturday and Sunday I would be working steadily through my subjects. I passed my final professional examination in December 1946. Moreover not only was I lacking job satisfaction but also I could see that our financial situation needed a boost if we were going to really pay off the house and rear a family.

So here we found ourselves working hard at one of our plans to set up a home where we could be happy, rear a family and offer hospitality but all the time in spite of this and our happy church relations aware that the work situation was not right. So I tried hard to find more compatible employment in the area and so often my qualifications were acceptable but my years of war service were not considered as adequate job experience. After a few, encounters like this I found myself faced with the offer of a Junior executive post on the `Nyasaland Railways <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi_Railways>`_ and as Vera and I prayed over this we felt strongly that this was God who was moving us on into the plan He had made for us. This may seem somewhat presumptuous but we had a simple trust in God and wanted to be available to Him and events over the years subsequently proved this to be right.

We accepted the offer and immediately began procedures to sell our house only so recently purchased, and certain items of furnishings and all of our furniture. Our crockery, cutlery, linen etc. were all packed by Thomas Cooks for shipment and there came the day when I was due to sail on the Llanstephan Castle from London. It was a very hot day in that very warm English summer of 1947. Vera came down to London with me the day previously. We spent the night there so that I could take the early morning boat train to Tilbury. I saw Vera off back to Bishop Auckland at Kings Cross Station then I took a taxi to Waterloo where I joined the boat train and later embarked at Tilbury. It was a very sad day. I wondered if I was mad. Out of three and a half years of married life we had spent one and a quarter years together and here I was going overseas in peacetime.

The trip was enjoyable. I travelled first class and I began to get a taste of the warmer weather as we journeyed on. After a call at Las Palmas we went on to Cape own taking a total of 3 weeks over the voyage. At Cape Town I was met by Thomas Cooks' representative who handed me rail tickets, bedding tickets and meal tickets for the whole journey from Cape Town in South Africa to `Limbe in Nyasaland <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Limbe,+Malawi/>`_.

It was exciting to think that I was now facing a journey into the African Interior but still I was feeling the loneliness and wondering how it would be with Vera back there in England. There were travelling with me two other men who had been recruited for Nyasaland Railways and both were bachelors. The Company had undertaken that once they were sure of being able to provide suitable married accommodation for us they would send Vera out without delay. In Cape Town I made contact with a family that had shown me hospitality when I had visited Cape Town in 1940 on a British troopship. How excited they were and happy to see me. They extended the same warm South African kindness to my two colleagues and they gave us a lovely day in Cape Town before seeing us off on the Rhodesia Mail train at 8.00 p.m.

It was a wonderful and interesting trip. We had good sleeping arrangements, meals were excellent and the whole journey most comfortable. It was interesting to travel across the Karoo, to pass Kimberley and Mafeking, travel through `Bechuanaland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechuanaland_Protectorate>`_ and finally after two and a half days enter the country then known as Southern Rhodesia. Arriving at Bulawayo on a bright and very warm morning in October and with the realisation that I was now in Central Africa we disembarked from the South African Railways train with all our luggage so that we could make our onward journey through Southern Rhodesia on a Rhodesia Railways train.


Chapter 2: Central Africa
=======================================


In my reading just prior to my departure from U.K. for Nyasaland I had learned that Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were regarded as `British Central Africa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Central_Africa_Protectorate>`_. So as I stepped from the South African Railways passenger train which had brought me from the Cape on a never to be forgotten journey it dawned on me that I was at last in Centra] Africa and that I was about to begin the last lap of my journey to Nyasaland. I wondered if my wife back there in County Durham could visualise the scene.

To me it was impressive. A large clean railways station under a clear blue sky, a temperature that warmed my bones as I began to look for my various pieces of luggage that were being brought out from the goods van. Clearance through customs was necessary although it was not difficult as was to be expected for people in transit. Here I was in `Bulawayo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulawayo>`_, hitherto only a name to me. I was amazed at the relaxed atmosphere, African porters taking care of luggage etc, all very cheerful and polite. My first impression on that Monday morning 5th October 1947 was very favourable.

My two travelling companions and I found the bathrooms provided on the Railway Station to be very welcome and for the princely sum of one shilling we each partook of a hot bath and had our shoes cleaned. We spent the whole day in Bulawayo with a Rhodesian friend of one of my companions. I can remember how I enjoyed the time spent in the National Museum and dinner in the evening at the Palace Hotel.

It was hard to stand up to the midday heat of October as we were travelling in our U.K. type clothing which was far too warm for the climate. We joined the Rhodesia Railways train at 9.00 p.m. that night all our luggage having already been loaded in the van and set off for Salisbury. We soon got our heads down and I can recall that I enjoyed the comfort of my sleeping berth. A set of train bedding was charged at two shillings in those days.

About 6 a.m. we were awakened by a knock on the door of our sleeping compartment and there stood a steward in clean white uniform carrying a large kettle full of steaming hot coffee, his white uniformed African Assistant had the hot milk and the sugar. I think we paid 9 Rhodesian pence for that cup of coffee and never do I recall having such a good cup of coffee and finding it so welcome.

The train hauled by `Garratt articulated locomotives <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garratt#Garratts_around_the_world>`_ steamed into Salisbury on time at 8 a.m. under a cloudless blue sky and on a very hot morning. After seeing our heavy luggage safely stored at the station with instructions for transhipment to our next train, we went into the city and booked into `Meikles Hotel <https://www.flickr.com/photos/68309522@N04/6921598402>`_ for we were not due to leave until the following evening Wednesday 7th October. The
hotel was very comfortable and of a high standard and we were well cared for except that there was a serious water shortage in Salisbury and there were restrictions in the bathrooms.

We spent two days looking around and seeing places of interest but we had to make an appointment with the Portuguese Consul in Salisbury to obtain from him visas to enable us to transit Portuguese East Africa (now called Moçambique) on our journey to Nyasaland. He found difficulty with this and we had to be very persistent. It was fortunate for us that his understanding of the English language was good. We had to show him documents relating to our appointments to the Nyasaland and Trans-Zambesia Railways and he told us to come back later. When we got back it was apparent that he had telephoned Trans-Zambesia Railways in Beira (PEA) for he presented each one of us with a short typewritten document in Portuguese which identified us as officials of the Nyasaland Railways and giving us authority to pass through `Portuguese East Africa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Mozambique>`_. This document in Portuguese I still have in my possession and I regard it as one of my "treasures".

.. note:: Does anyone have a copy of this document?

So it was that at 8 p.m. on the night of 7 October we entrained for Beira, on the Rhodesia Railways train. The coaching stock on which we were travelling went right through to `Beira <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beira,_Mozambique>`_. Next morning we awoke just before Umtali in the Eastern Highlands of Rhodesia - again the morning coffee episode was repeated with much pleasure. There was no dining car on the train nor was there a dining room at the station so all the passengers went to Brown's Hotel in Umtali for breakfast.

When we rejoined the train a dining car had been included in the composition of the train for the day long journey down to Beira through the hot tropical area of Portuguese East Africa known as Manica and Sofala. Umtali looked beautiful as it lay among the mountains in the clear morning light. Our descent began almost immediately down the winding pass to what is now called Machipanda. After clearing the PEA customs and immigration the journey proceeded down a steady incline to the coastal plains and the Pungwe flats.

In those days the railroad right through to Beira was owned by the Beira Mashonaland Railways (Rhodesia Railways) and the Dining car was manned by the Rhodesians as was the train staff. As the day wore on we became uncomfortably hot and thirst was ever present. The dining car service was good but we remained very conscious of how our dress was totally unsuitable for the climate. Stations named Vila Pery, Gondola, Vila Machado were passed in the course of the day as the train rolled on stopping for water and coal at different places.

As evening began we passed Dondo, a place that was to become very meaningful to each of us as it formed the junction of the Trans-Zambesia Railways (from Nyasaland) with the BMR to Beira. We soon learned that TZR had an agreement with BMR for running rights between Dondo and Beira. We pulled into a very hot and humid Beira at almost 6 p.m. Here we found the Railway station facilities to be rather more primitive as we descended from the coaching stock to the track below - there were no platforms. We found ourselves with two hours in which to ensure that we were booked on the 8 p.m.
(twice weekly) train for Nyasaland.

After ensuring the safe transfer of our luggage we got on to the Nyasaland Railways coaching stock which was marshalled in Beira as part of (the later to become well known) 100 up. Settled into our sleep-compartment and with tickets for the dining car we realised that here was our first contact with the railway which was going to become very important for us in the days ahead.

First impressions were not encouraging. The coaching stock and dining car were nothing like those we had experienced in South Africa and Rhodesia during the last few days and there was a general appearance of being down at heel so to speak. The dining car was manned by an European called Charlie Sharman who had a contract with Nyasaland Railways to supply a dining car and bar service.

Actually the food was very good and the train bedding was quite good. It was necessary to sleep with mosquito nets tucked in on our sleeping berths but as the train trundled through the tropical night which had fallen over the thick bush of PEA we were sure of one thing - it was extremely hot and humid. Again we were greeted with coffee in our compartment when we awoke next morning. The Portuguese conductor (Sr dos Santos) explained that we were approaching Sena on the South bank of the Zambesi.

We were aware of the most bright sunlight ever encountered and the heat was simply oppressive. We got to the dining car as soon as possible for there were ceiling fans there which stirred up the hot atmosphere a little bit.

It was in the dining car of the Nyasaland Railways on the morning of Friday 9th October 1947 that I met a man who was to be a colleague for many years. This was Joe Robson, known as Robbie to everyone. He was a storekeeper at the main stores in Limbe, Nyasaland. He had been there 6 months.  His wife and child were living with him in Limbe having come with him from U.K. He had apparently been on duty for a week at Inhaminga on the TZR and he was returning home on the mail train. We took this opportunity lo find out as much out as much as we could about everything that we could think of concerning what lay ahead of us. He gave us fair replies to all our questions but we realised later than we all have to form our own impressions.

At Sena a Nyasaland Railways locomotive and train crew took over from the TZR engine and train crew. We found this very interesting. The train was hauled by D class No 24 driver Gulam Hussein and the conductor was also an Asian named Sardar Mohamed
who was a friendly man eager to supply us with information.

Leaving Sena we passed over the lower `Zambezi bridge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Falls_Bridge>`_. This is a very long steel bridge which was completed by the Cleveland Bridge Company of Darlington, England in 1935 - it connects the TZR with the Central African and Nyasaland Railways on the through rail route Beira to Lake Nyasa.

Among my treasures I have a number of photographs of the bridge over which I was to travel many times during my life time. We were discovering that October is really the hottest month in that part of the world. The journey over the CAR from Dona Ana on the north bank of the Zambezi to Port Herald is only just over 40 miles but it took a good two hours and we were just bathed in perspiration.

.. note:: Anyone have some of these photos?

Before we could leave Dona Ana we had to clear the PEA customs and immigration and our passports were now beginning to collect a few stamps. But our arrival at Port Herald was quote another matter. Here we officially entered Nyasaland and we encountered British colonial presence. This station is on the banks of the wide flowing Shire river - it is plagued with mosquitos and marabou storks.

The coaching stock was shunted down to a siding near the river for clearance by immigration and customs. We found out later that the arrivals of the mail train at places like Dona Ana and Port Herald were real social occasions and government officials not only exercised their right to board the train to check documents and luggage but also to quench their thirst in the dining car. In those days a couple of new Europeans out from U.K. arriving in Nyasaland were rare birds and in those immediate post war days we younger ones were quickly pigeon holed by the "poo-bahs" and called "war misfits". I must confess that in those early days I wondered sometimes if it was a correct description. So the officials at Port Herald showed great interest.

Our train began its journey northwards and after 2 and a half hours we crossed the Shire River bridge at Chiromo. All that could be said was that there was a cotton ginnery there and that it was jolly hot and humid. An hour later came Sankulani, coal and water, a banking engine attached and then the climb up the escarpment. As the ascent progressed we became accustomed to the screaming of wheel flanges on tight curves, of beautiful scenery changing at every turn of the line and a slow cooling off in the temperature.

Sometimes the view from a carriage window would be that of the two locomotives hauling the train appearing to be almost alongside and above the carriage but actually struggling on the other side of a very tight curve on a steep gradient. This section from Sankulani to Limbe was so far as I can remember about 66 miles but it took a long time to make it. The gradients and curves were difficult and the stops for water were time consuming.

Almost every up train had to be banked so in those days of steam it meant two locos to be coaled and watered. The mountain scenery became very impressive and as it got cooler we began to feel a bit more optimistic. The train got into Limbe almost on time, we got off, luggage came off and journey's end arrived at 5.30 p.m. Friday 9 October 1947, more than 4 weeks after leaving Tilbury.

I was met by a railwayman called Harry Dawes who took me to his two roomed home (part of a Railway house) and showed me one room that was part of the same railway house, which was allocated to me. It contained a camp bed and mosquito net and a very ancient chest of drawers and a water filter (part of life when the water came from wells in those days). My trunks and suit case fitted into this large room very easily. Harry Dawes told me that I could get a meal at the Limbe Hotel and that there was another room containing a galvanised bath next door to my room.

In next to no time an African pitched up. His name was James and he agreed to be my personal "boy" for 16/- per month and 1/-
per week poso (food money). It wasn't clear what work he would do for me with such primitive living conditions but I soon found out that he could be very useful, I had been told I would need a boy and as soon as that I found I had one.

Very quickly he found a 4 gallon petrol tin with a wire handle, pumped water from the well, filled the tin and heated it over someone's stove and made a bath for me. It was great to have a bath not having had one since leaving Salisbury 48 hours earlier and having really experienced travel in intense heat and humidity.

With my trunk unpacked I looked for a wardrobe to hang such as I had but found none. Those were the days when wartime experience still lingered with me and improvisation came easy to me. I found a hook on one wall of the room, on the opposite side the window had burglar bars (like those of a prison) and the rope that had been slung around my trunk now found itself slung from hook to burglar bars
and carrying my few belongings including my `demob suit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demob_suit>`_ although I realised that in this climate it would be. of little use. Oh, I forgot there was also a basket
chair in the room (they cost 3/6 in those days) so having got my things unpacked and feeling better for a bath I sat down and surveyed my new "home" in the light of a very faint electric light bulb dangling from the ceiling. I wondered if I was seeing things - to think I had sold up a nice home in U.K. and left my wife behind for this! I could only think that the rewards must be very great and I must admit that at first it did not appear so. However the need for food and refreshment needed attention.
